## FAQ

#### Is this a virus?

No, our app is 100% safe and has no virus inside it or any kind of keylogger, etc.

#### Why dose windows show a warning when i open the app?
Because the app is not signed by Microsoft yet.

#### Is this really free?
Yes it's totally free forever

#### "Login failed." What does that mean?
Well this can mean a some things, here is a list:
→ The host is using CloudFlare, but it is not configured correctly.
→ The panel URL is wrong, or it is not a panel.
→ Some of the credentials you provided are wrong.
→ You are not connected to the internet.

#### The app is slow, and the rendering is sh*t.
Yeah, we can't do anything about that if you have a sh*t PC.

#### The app is closing instantly and does not even show
This can mean a multitude of things. Why it would do that:
→ You are not running Windows (Linux is blocked by the code itself).
→ You are missing some files. 
→ You have broken files.
→ Your Windows is broken!

#### I'm a developer, and I don't have a GunaUI license!
→ Well, you can use their trial for 14 days.
→ Close the popup every time.
